# Vagrant Environment 

* [ansible-playbook-bundle](https://github.com/ansibleplaybookbundle/ansible-playbook-bundle)
* [okd](https://www.okd.io/)
* [Openshift ansible role](https://github.com/openshift/openshift-ansible)

This is for testing Rolling updates with Ansible and Packer.

## first tests

For first tests you can use the  following

`./init-env.sh centos-7.json`

that script executes packer first to start your own box with vagrant.
In this case i used for example centos7 but you can also choose:

- centos8.json
- debian-10.json (not well tested)
- ubuntu-1805.json
